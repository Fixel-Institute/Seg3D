# Start New Project

This option is the same as the **File** â‡’ **[New Project](<user_docs/Manuals/Functions/BasicProgramFunctions/File:New Project>)** menu item. It will display the [New Project Wizard](<user_docs/Manuals/Functions/BasicProgramFunctions/File:New Project>), allowing the user to choose a project name and location so that the project can be saved easily and automatically.
