# Start New Project

This option is the same as the **File** â‡’ **[New Project](File.md#new-project)** menu item. It will display the New Project Wizard ([Figure 5.1](File.md#newproject)), allowing the user to choose a project name and location so that the project can be saved easily and automatically.
